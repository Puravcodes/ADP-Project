## Technology Stack
- **Python**: For application logic and functionality
- **Tkinter**: For the graphical user interface
- **SQLite/MySQL**: For database storage of survey responses

This project is perfect for exploring user interface design with Tkinter, basic authentication, and database integration in Python. Feel free to clone and experiment with the code!
